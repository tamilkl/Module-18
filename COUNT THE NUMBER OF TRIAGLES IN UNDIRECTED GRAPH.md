# Ex.No:12A Count the Number of Triangles in an Undirected Graph

## AIM
To write a Python program to count the number of triangles present in an undirected graph.


## Algorithm

1. **Input the Graph**:
   - Start by taking the number of vertices as input.
   - Represent the graph using an adjacency matrix where `graph[i][j]` indicates the presence of an edge between vertices `i` and `j`.

2. **Matrix Multiplication**:
   - Initialize matrices `aux2` and `aux3` for storing the square and cube of the adjacency matrix respectively.
   - Multiply the adjacency matrix (`graph`) with itself to compute `aux2 = graph^2`.
   - Multiply the result (`aux2`) with the adjacency matrix again to compute `aux3 = graph^3`.

3. **Trace Calculation**:
   - The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. The diagonal elements of `aux3` represent the number of paths of length 3 starting and ending at each vertex.
   - Compute the trace of `aux3` to find the total number of triangles.

4. **Divide by 6**:
   - The number of triangles is the trace of `aux3` divided by 6. This is because each triangle is counted six times in the trace.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - The program outputs the number of triangles present in the undirected graph.

## Program
```
# A Python3 program for finding number of
# triangles in an Undirected Graph. The
# program is for adjacency matrix
# representation of the graph

# Utility function for matrix
# multiplication
def multiply(A, B, C):
	global V
	for i in range(V):
		for j in range(V):
			C[i][j] = 0
			for k in range(V):
				C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]

# Utility function to calculate
# trace of a matrix (sum of
# diagonal elements)
def getTrace(graph):
	global V
	trace = 0
	for i in range(V):
		trace += graph[i][i]
	return trace

# Utility function for calculating
# number of triangles in graph
def triangleInGraph(graph):
	global V
	
	# To Store graph^2
	aux2 = [[None] * V for i in range(V)]

	# To Store graph^3
	aux3 = [[None] * V for i in range(V)]

	# Initialising aux
	# matrices with 0
	for i in range(V):
		for j in range(V):
			aux2[i][j] = aux3[i][j] = 0

	# aux2 is graph^2 now printMatrix(aux2)
	multiply(graph, graph, aux2)

	# after this multiplication aux3 is
	# graph^3 printMatrix(aux3)
	multiply(graph, aux2, aux3)

	trace = getTrace(aux3)
	return trace // 6

# Driver Code

# Number of vertices in the graph
V = int(input())
graph = [[0, 1, 1, 0],
		[1, 0, 1, 1],
		[1, 1, 0, 1],
		[0, 1, 1, 0]]

print("Total number of Triangle in Graph :",
					triangleInGraph(graph))
```
